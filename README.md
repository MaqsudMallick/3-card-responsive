## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- the CSS grid classes of bootstrap does not work properly when a fixed length of the row class is set up. The Cols that were supposed to be responsive are forever stuck in a the given length of the row losing the responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- GIMP Image Editor
